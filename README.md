I've just started to learn C++ using `Stroustrup: "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++"` - http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/ .

I will use this repository to store my exercises and to discuss any questions with my collegues and any one interested in learning C++ or helping me to learn it.
